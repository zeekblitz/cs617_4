For this Project I wanted to display a linear change in Professors pay compared to their Rate My Professor rating. I Believe I have visually achieved that but something must be off with my math so upon a scroll down the Y axis go extremely high. I couldn't figure out how to 'clamp' the new y-values to the min and max of the original y values. One thing that I was able to get working however was the datapoints resizing when they are hovered according to their number of ratings.
